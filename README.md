## What is Explorer?

This is a simple website to track event propagation across Farcaster. In some cases, a cast or user event that occurred on a hub can take up to 4 hours to propagate across the network. This site lets you see where in a network a given user or cast has been propagated.

## Getting Started

First, get your NEYNAR_API_KEY from https://www.neynar.com, then run the following command:
```bash
npm i && npm run dev
```
