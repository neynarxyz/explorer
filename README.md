## What is Explorer?

This is a simple website to track event propagation across Farcaster. In some cases, a cast or user event that occurred on a hub can take up to 4 hours to propagate across the network. This site lets you see where in a network a given user or cast has been propagated.

## Getting Started

1. First, get you `NEYNAR_API_KEY` from the [Neynar dev portal](https://dev.neynar.com)
2. Copy `.env.example` to a new `.env.local` file and add your Neynar API key
3. Install local dependencies with `npm i`
4. Run the app locally with `npm run dev`
